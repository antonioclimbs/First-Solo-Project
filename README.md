# First-Solo-Project

In this project, I plan to improve upon a classic website/game cookie clicker. The main goal for this project is to practice creating an entire project from scratch including both frontend and backend development. One focus will be to practice redux and react while having multiple moving parts in throughout the project.

This will test patience and resilience starting from nothing and creating a functioning website. I believe that this will be a great challenge and will be a reflection on how much I know and what my strengths and weaknesses. I hope this reflects in my work.
